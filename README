thebrig is a set of PHP pages used to create and manage FreeBSD jails on Xigmanas (Nas4Free). 

The main advantage of thebrig is that it leverages the existing webgui control 
and accounting mechanisms found within Nas4Free, and can be used on an embedded 
installation. It uses native utilities to create, start, stop, update and administer jails.

The installation of this would be accomplished by running thebrig_install script that will 
fetch the tarball of the necessary files from github, extract them to the install directory, 
and create a file /tmp/thebrig.tmp that contains the install path. Upon the extension's first 
run, this data would be read by the webgui, and subsequently stored in the Nas4Free XML config. 

TL,DR version steps:
1. Download thebrig_install.sh
2. Make it executable
3. Execute it, and pass the desired destination as the argument to the script like this
nas4free # /bin/sh /tmp/thebrig_install.sh /mnt/pool1/brig_folder
